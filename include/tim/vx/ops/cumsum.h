 * ## Cumsum
 *
 * Compute the cumulative sum of the tensor along the giveb axis. By default, it 
 * will do the sum inclusively meaning the first element is copied as is. Through 
 * an exclusive attribute, this behavior can change to exclude the first element. 
 * It can also perform summation in the opposite direction of the axis by setting 
 * reverse atrribution to 1.
 * All the attributes can be combined.
 * - axis : Specify the cumsum eperforming along which axis.Default = 0.
 * - exclusive : If exclusive = 1, perform exclusive cumsum.
 * - reverse : If reverse = 1, the cumsum is performed in the opposite direction.
