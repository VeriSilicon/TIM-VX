 * ## DepthToSpace
 *
 * DepthToSpace rearranges (permutes) data from depth into blocks of spatial data.
 * This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth.
 *
 * Chunks of data of size block_size * block_size from depth are rearranged into
 * non-overlapping blocks of size block_size x block_size.
 *
 * The width of the output tensor is input_depth * block_size, whereas the height
 * is input_height * block_size. The depth of the input tensor must be divisible
 * by block_size * block_size
 *
 * - crop : corp the output tensor for ROI usage.
