 * ## Mod
 *
 * Mod performs element-wise binary modulus. 
 * The sign of the remainder is the same as that of the Divisor as default.
 *
 * Mod operator can also behave like C fmod() or numpy.fmod when input type is floating 
 * point. The sign of the remainder however, will be the same as the Dividend. Attribute
 * fmod is set to decide the mod behivior.
 *
 * - fmod : If the input type is floating point, then fmod must be set to 1.Default = 0
 * means integer mod.
